# An implementation of Ubiregi API client, which wraps sending HTTP requests and conversion of requests from/to JSON.
# The class is developed as an example of the API, it is not recommended to use this in production.

  #  The token to identify which account is accessing. The token is generated for each installation of the app in ubiregi.com.
